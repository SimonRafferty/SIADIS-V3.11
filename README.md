Software for configuring old Siemens EV Motors

Long ago, I built an Electric freelander using a Siemens Motor & Controller I found in a junk yard!
It took me a year to reverse-engineer the controller with the help of several people on line - but eventually got it running.

The software will only run on an old DOS 4 / 5 PC (386 / 486).  You will also need an RS232 to K/L Line adaptor to get the PC to speak to the controller.
